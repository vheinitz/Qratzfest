A remote-protocol getaway for MIT's Scratch - development environment for Children.

MIT's Scratch is a graphical programming language and an IDE developed for teaching children the programming.
One interesting feature is the ability to communicate over a simple TCP-based protocol with external programs.

The aim of this project is to create a flexible getaway, which will allow to 
 *control external hartware
 *communicate with other Scratch-instance on another computer
 
The first version will allow to set and read control pins of a serial interface. With that it it will be possible to implement simple and cheap models like a trafic light; sensors for light, water, temperature-limit; elevator; etc controlled by a Scratch-program.
